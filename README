Hello otters.

You can put your shit in this git repo.

Your assigned port range is 39410-39419, and you may use these for anything you want. At the moment, any ports from 39000-39999 should be publicly accessible and you can bind to anything, but don't assume that they always will be or that I won't implement some kind of user control feature in the future. If you want more ports, just ask me; I'm going to keep track of them in a list.

Your HTTP server should use port 39410. If you want more processes, let me know, and I can bind to more ports. I can also set it up via UNIX socket, if you'd prefer, but proxying a public port allows you to do things like WebSockets, which nginx doesn't support and the user isn't going to see, so it doesn't matter if it's on an altport.

You'll want to use Bundler for your gems. I think Rails uses this by default now, but I can't remember. Anyway, any time you change your Gemfile, you must 'bundle install' locally and then commit the resulting Gemfile.lock. You probably already know this. I don't know. The reason is that the start.sh script I included uses `bundle install --deployment`, which helps sandbox your stuff. In fact I bet it won't work otherwise.

./start.sh and ./stop.sh should work with just about anything as they are, including Rails, as long as you delete the config.ru included and replace them with your own.

Have fun.
